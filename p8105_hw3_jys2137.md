The purpose of this file is to present the answers to Homework 3, an
assignment reinforcing ideas in the **Visualization & EDA** topic for
P8105.

## Problem 1

This problem uses **“The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset
2017”**, an anonymized dataset with over 3 million online grocery orders
from more than 200,000 Instacart (online grocery service) users.

### Loading in of *Instacart* data

First, we read in the dataset through the code chunk below.

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

### Exploration of the *Instacart* dataset

The next few steps allow for exploration of the *instacart* dataset.

#### 1. Description of the dataset

The ‘Instacart’ dataset includes **1384617 rows** and **15 columns**,
where each row in the dataset is a product from an instacart order. It
consists of **131209 orders** from **131209 unique users**, including a
total of **39123 products**.

Key variables include identifiers for **order** (`order_id`),
**product** (`product_id`), and **customer** (`user_id`). Other
variables provide information on the order such as the order in which
each product was added to cart (`add_to_cart_order`), if the product has
been reordered in the past (`reordered`), and the day and time on which
the order was placed (`order_dow`and `order_hour_of_day`). In addition,
variables containing the specifics of each product were included such as
the name (e.g., “Bulgarian Yogurt”, “Mild Diced Green Chiles”, “Organic
Raspberries”), aisle (e.g. “yogurt”, “canned jarred vegetables”.
packaged vegetables fruits“), and department of the product (e.g.,”dairy
eggs“,”canned goods“,”produce").

#### 2. Aisle specific exploration

##### Aisles most ordered from

There are **134 aisles** and the aisles most ordered from are *fresh
vegetables* and *fresh fruits* as seen in the table produced below,
which shows the top 10 aisles that most items are ordered from.

``` r
aisle_table =
  instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(n = 10) %>% 
  mutate(row_number = 1:n()) %>% 
  select(row_number, aisle, n) %>% 
  knitr::kable(
             caption = "**_Fig. 1. Top 10 Aisles Most Ordered From_**",
             col.names = c('Rank', 'Aisle', 'N'),
             align = "clc")

aisle_table
```

| Rank | Aisle                         |   N    |
|:----:|:------------------------------|:------:|
|  1   | fresh vegetables              | 150609 |
|  2   | fresh fruits                  | 150473 |
|  3   | packaged vegetables fruits    | 78493  |
|  4   | yogurt                        | 55240  |
|  5   | packaged cheese               | 41699  |
|  6   | water seltzer sparkling water | 36617  |
|  7   | milk                          | 32644  |
|  8   | chips pretzels                | 31269  |
|  9   | soy lactosefree               | 26240  |
|  10  | bread                         | 23635  |
